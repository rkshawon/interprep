What is program?

- A program, often referred to as source code or just code, is a set of
  special instructions to tell the computer what tasks to perform.
- The rules for valid format and combinations of instructions is called
  a computer language, sometimes referred to as its syntax
- In a computer language, a group of words, numbers, and operators
  that performs a specific task is a statement. a = b \* 2;

- By contrast, the 2 is just a value itself, called a literal value, because it
  stands alone without being stored in a variable.

- The = and \* characters are operators. they perform actions with the values and variables such as assign‐
  ment and mathematic multiplication.

- Statements are made up of one or more expressions. An expression is
  any reference to a variable or value, or a set of variable(s) and
  value(s) combined with operators.
  For example:
  a = b _ 2;
  This statement has four expressions in it:
  • 2 is a literal value expression.
  • b is a variable expression, which means to retrieve its current
  value.
  • b _ 2 is an arithmetic expression, which means to do the multi-
  plication.
  • a = b _ 2 is an assignment expression, which means to assign
  the result of the b _ 2 expression to the variable a (more on
  assignments later).
  A general expression that stands alone is also called an expression
  statement, such as the following:
  b \* 2;

#### Summary

- JS runs on JS Engine/Interpreters/Runtime Environment via a browser or NodesJS

- JS lang doesn't need to be installed like java or python, it comes with the Interpreter

- JS is program logic, whereas Interpreters provide features/API, which can be interacted via JS lang

- LiveScript was created by Brendan Eich within 10 days

- It had many loopholes to work on

- LiveScript was a combination of Java Syntax(to attract Java programmers) + OOP + Functional Programming

- LiveScript was renamed to JavaScript to attract Java programmers

- JavaScript had to be renamed to ECMAScript due to copyright issues

- Vanilla JS is basic JS

- ECMA International decideds standards for ECMAScript

- ECMA International is an European Organization

- ECMAScript had a gap of 10 years b/w each version up to 6

- ECMA Script versions were released yearly starting from version 7

- TC-39 a committee of Browser Vendors who decides JS features and adopt it onto their own JS Engines(Interpreters)

- AngularJS/VueJS/ReactJS are JS frameworks

- Creating and modifying UI is expensive, it takes a lot of processing load(ex:- reason why GPUs are expensive)

- JS frameworks have their own version of JS called JSX

- JS frameworks optimizes UI written in their version of JS and optimizes it and deploys(reducing the processing load)
