# JavaScript and Programming Fundamentals

#### Variables

Variables are the names we give to computer memory locations which are used to store values in a computer program.

#### Operators

An operator in a programming language is a symbol that tells the compiler or interpreter to perform specific mathematical, relational or logical operation and produce final result.

#### Operands

An operand is the part of an instruction representing the data manipulated by the operator.

#### Objects

JavaScript object is a non-primitive data-type that allows you to store multiple collections of data in key value pair.

#### Scope

In JavaScript, scope refers to the context in which variables and functions are declared and accessed. It determines the visibility and accessibility of variables and functions throughout your code.

#### Hoisting

Hoisting in JavaScript is a behavior where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase, regardless of where they are declared in the code. This means that variables and functions can be used before they are actually declared in the code.

#### Error Handling

Error handling is the process of managing errors.

#### Asynchronous Programming

Asynchronous programming is a programming paradigm that allows multiple tasks to be executed concurrently, without blocking the execution of the code. In JavaScript, asynchronous programming is commonly achieved through mechanisms such as:

- Callbacks
- Promises
- Async/await syntax

Asynchronous programming is used to handle multiple concurrent tasks efficiently, such as fetching data from servers, handling user interactions, and updating the UI dynamically.

#### Programs and Code

A program, often referred to as source code or just code, is a set of special instructions to tell the computer what tasks to perform.

##### Key Components

- The rules for valid format and combinations of instructions is called a computer language, sometimes referred to as its syntax
- In a computer language, a group of words, numbers, and operators that performs a specific task is a statement. Example: `a = b * 2;`
- A literal value (like `2`) stands alone without being stored in a variable
- Operators (like `=` and `*`) perform actions with values and variables such as assignment and mathematical multiplication

##### Expressions

Statements are made up of one or more expressions. An expression is any reference to a variable or value, or a set of variable(s) and value(s) combined with operators.

######## Example Statement Analysis

```javascript
a = b * 2;
```

This statement contains four expressions:

1. `2` - a literal value expression
2. `b` - a variable expression (retrieves current value)
3. `b * 2` - an arithmetic expression (performs multiplication)
4. `a = b * 2` - an assignment expression (assigns result to variable a)

A general expression that stands alone is also called an expression statement, such as:

```javascript
b * 2;
```

#### JavaScript Overview

JavaScript is a high-level, dynamically-typed programming language primarily used for web development. Key characteristics include:

- Synchronous and single-threaded in nature
- Object-based: everything in JavaScript is an object
- Template-based rather than class-based
- Flexible: can be used for web development, server-side scripting (Node.js), desktop applications, and IoT programming
- Makes web pages interactive and user-friendly

##### Interesting JavaScript Fact

```javascript
var a = (b = 3);
// is equivalent to:
b = 3;
var a = b;
```

#### Compilation vs Interpretation

##### Compiler

A compiler translates the entire program into machine code before execution.

- Translates entire code from high-level language to machine code before execution
- Takes more time for analysis
- Code runs faster after compilation
- Displays all errors after compilation
- Won't compile if code has errors

##### Interpreter

An interpreter translates and executes code line by line at runtime, without producing a separate executable file.

- Translates code line-by-line during execution
- Takes less time for analysis
- Code runs slower compared to compiled code
- Displays errors one by one
- Can contain compilers for optimization

##### Just-in-Time (JIT) Compilation

Modern JavaScript engines use JIT compilation for better performance. The process involves:

1. **Interpretation**: Initial line-by-line code execution
2. **Profiling**: Monitoring execution and identifying frequently used code (hot paths)
3. **Optimization**: Generating optimized machine code for hot paths
4. **Compilation**: Creating machine code for identified hot paths
5. **Caching**: Storing generated machine code for reuse
6. **Execution**: Direct execution of optimized machine code

##### Dynamic Compilation

JIT compiler translates programs into machine code on-the-fly, just before execution, instead of compiling the entire program ahead of time.

#### Logical Operators

##### OR (||) Operator

- If both operands are true: returns first value
- If both operands are false: returns last value
- If one is false: returns the true value

##### AND (&&) Operator

- If both operands are true: returns last value
- If both operands are false: returns first value
- If one is false: returns the false value

##### Nullish Coalescing Operator (??)

- Similar to || but treats falsy values differently
- Only considers `null` and `undefined` as false
- Other falsy values (0, "") are considered true

#### String Padding

```javascript
const originalString = "42";
const paddedString = originalString.padEnd(5, "*");
console.log(paddedString); // Outputs: '42***'
```

#### Issues with Dynamically Typed Languages

1. **Type Errors at Runtime**: Type checking occurs during execution
2. **Reduced Performance**: Dynamic type determination affects speed
3. **Readability Issues**: Code can be less maintainable
4. **Complex Debugging**: Type-related issues surface during runtime

#### Package Management

##### NPM (Node Package Manager)

- Tool for automating package management
- Handles finding, downloading, installing, configuring, upgrading, and removing packages
- Works with package registry (database for packages)

#### Modules

A module is a file containing code for a specific task, including variables, functions, and classes.

#### Scripting Languages

Scripting refers to writing small programs (scripts) that automate tasks, manipulate data, or control other software.
A scripting language is a type of programming language designed to automate tasks, control software, or create dynamic behavior in applications.
Scripting languages are often interpreted, meaning they do not require compilation before execution.

- Interpreted and executed at runtime
- Used for task automation and software control
- Enables interaction between software components

#### Libraries vs Frameworks

##### Libraries

A library is a collection of functions, classes, or modules that you can call in your code to perform specific tasks.
It provides tools that you use as needed, but you control the overall flow of your application.

**Pros:**

- Flexible usage
- Lightweight
- Specialized functionality
- Lower learning curve
- No structure constraints

**Cons:**

- Limited guidance
- More integration work
- Potential compatibility issues

##### Frameworks

A framework is a more complete structure that provides a foundation for your application.
It controls the flow of execution and dictates how your code should be organized. Instead of calling it directly,
the framework calls your code when necessary.

**Pros:**

- Consistent structure
- Rapid development
- Handles program flow
- Strong community support
- Built-in testing tools

**Cons:**

- Steep learning curve
- Less flexibility
- Additional overhead
- Can be complex for small projects

##### Key Differences

- Libraries target specific functionality; frameworks provide complete application infrastructure
- Libraries offer control; frameworks enforce structure
- Libraries are better for small applications; frameworks for large applications
