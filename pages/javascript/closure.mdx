## Closures in JavaScript

## ##üåü What is a Closure?

A closure is a function that remembers its outer variables and can access them even after the outer function has finished executing.

In simple terms, a closure allows an inner function to remember and use variables from its outer function's scope even after the outer function has returned.

## ##‚öôÔ∏è How Closures Work Under the Hood

##### Execution Context

When JavaScript executes a function, it creates an Execution Context with two main phases:

**Creation Phase:**

- A new execution context is created.
- Variables, functions, and the this keyword are set up.
- Outer variables (from the parent scope) are referenced through the [[Environment]] (or lexical environment).

**Execution Phase:**

- Code is executed line by line.
- Functions can access their outer scopes using the Scope Chain.

##### Memory Creation

- When a function is declared, it captures the surrounding variables (using lexical scoping).
- Even after the outer function exits, the inner function retains a reference to those variables.
- These variables are kept in memory because the inner function forms a closure over them.

##### Example:

```javascript
function outer() {
  let count = 0; // Outer variable

  return function inner() {
    count++;
    console.log(count);
  };
}

const counter = outer();
counter(); // 1
counter(); // 2
```

**Explanation:**

1. `outer()` returns `inner()`.
2. When `outer()` finishes execution, its execution context is removed from the stack, but the `count` variable remains in memory because the returned `inner()` function still holds a reference to it.
3. Each time `counter()` is called, it accesses the `count` variable via closure.

## ##üî• Common Interview Questions on Closures

##### 1. What is a closure in JavaScript?

**Answer:** A closure is created when a function remembers the variables from its outer scope even after the outer function has finished executing. This allows the inner function to access those variables anytime.

##### 2. How do closures help achieve data encapsulation?

**Answer:** Closures allow variables to be private by keeping them within a function's lexical scope.

**Example:**

```javascript
function createCounter() {
  let count = 0;

  return {
    increment() {
      count++;
    },
    getCount() {
      return count;
    },
  };
}

const counter = createCounter();
console.log(counter.getCount()); // 0
counter.increment();
console.log(counter.getCount()); // 1
```

Here, `count` cannot be accessed directly ‚Äî only via the methods provided, ensuring encapsulation.

##### 3. Why do loops with var and setTimeout produce unexpected outputs?

**Answer:** `var` is function-scoped, so the loop's callback captures the same variable, which has the final value after the loop ends.

**Example:**

```javascript
for (var i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
  setTimeout(() => console.log(i), 1000);
}
// Outputs: 4, 4, 4
```

**Fix:** Use `let` or create a closure.

```javascript
for (var i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
  (function (j) {
    setTimeout(() => console.log(j), 1000);
  })(i);
}
// Outputs: 1, 2, 3
```

##### 4. What is the difference between a closure and a callback?

**Answer:**

- A callback is a function passed to another function to be executed later.
- A closure is created when a function captures variables from its outer scope.

**Example:**

```javascript
function fetchData(callback) {
  const data = "Hello";
  callback(data);
}

fetchData((data) => console.log(data)); // 'Hello'
```

Here, the callback doesn't necessarily create a closure unless it accesses outer variables.

##### 5. How do closures work in React hooks?

**Answer:** React hooks like useState and useEffect rely on closures to capture state values at the time of rendering.

**Example:**

```jsx
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);

  function handleClick() {
    setCount(count + 1); // closure over count
  }

  return <button onClick={handleClick}>{count}</button>;
}
```

Here, `handleClick` forms a closure by accessing `count` even though the component might re-render.

## ##üöÄ Top 10 Closure Interview Coding Questions

##### 1. Basic closure example:

```javascript
function outer() {
  let a = 10;
  return function inner() {
    console.log(a);
  };
}
const innerFunc = outer();
innerFunc();
```

**Q: What will be logged?**  
**A:** 10 ‚Äî `inner()` retains access to `a`.

##### 2. Counter with closure:

```javascript
function createCounter() {
  let count = 0;
  return function () {
    return ++count;
  };
}
const counter = createCounter();
console.log(counter()); // ?
console.log(counter()); // ?
```

**A:** 1, 2 ‚Äî The count is preserved.

##### 3. Loop with setTimeout:

```javascript
for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  setTimeout(() => console.log(i), 1000);
}
```

**Q: What will be logged?**  
**A:** 3, 3, 3 ‚Äî Fixed by using `let` or IIFE.

##### 4. Private variables:

```javascript
function secret() {
  let hidden = "hidden";
  return () => hidden;
}
const getSecret = secret();
console.log(getSecret()); // ?
```

**A:** 'hidden'

##### 5. Closure with multiple functions:

```javascript
function multiplier(factor) {
  return (number) => number * factor;
}
const double = multiplier(2);
console.log(double(5)); // ?
```

**A:** 10

##### 6. Preserving variable values:

```javascript
function createAdder(x) {
  return function (y) {
    return x + y;
  };
}
const add5 = createAdder(5);
console.log(add5(3)); // ?
```

**A:** 8

##### 7. Functions returning functions:

```javascript
const add = (a) => (b) => a + b;
console.log(add(2)(3)); // ?
```

**A:** 5

##### 8. Chained closures:

```javascript
function outer() {
  let count = 0;
  return function inner() {
    return ++count;
  };
}
const counter1 = outer();
const counter2 = outer();
console.log(counter1()); // ?
console.log(counter2()); // ?
```

**A:** 1, 1

##### 9. Closure in setTimeout:

```javascript
const arr = [1, 2, 3];
arr.forEach((val) => setTimeout(() => console.log(val), 1000));
```

**A:** 1, 2, 3

##### 10. Memory leaks with closures:

**Q: How can closures cause memory leaks?**  
**A:** If references to outer scopes are not cleared, memory can be retained unnecessarily.
