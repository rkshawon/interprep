## Polyfill: What, Why, and How?

A polyfill is a piece of code (usually written in JavaScript) that provides modern functionality to older browsers or environments that do not natively support it.

#### What is a Polyfill?

A polyfill is essentially a shim (a script that replicates a missing feature) for browsers that do not support a particular JavaScript feature.

##### Example of a Polyfill

If an old browser does not support the Array.prototype.includes method, we can write a polyfill like this:

- For string, we would use String.prototype.includes:

```javascript
if (!Array.prototype.includes) {
  Array.prototype.includes = function (searchElement, fromIndex) {
    if (this == null)
      throw new TypeError(
        "Cannot read property 'includes' of null or undefined"
      );

    let arr = Object(this);
    let len = arr.length >>> 0;
    if (len === 0) return false;

    let start = fromIndex | 0;
    let k = Math.max(start >= 0 ? start : len - Math.abs(start), 0);

    while (k < len) {
      if (arr[k] === searchElement) return true;
      k++;
    }
    return false;
  };
}
```

Now, Array.prototype.includes() will work in older browsers!

#### Why Do We Need Polyfills?

Polyfills help ensure backward compatibility by allowing newer JavaScript features to work in older browsers.

##### Use Cases

- Older Browsers: Some browsers do not support modern features
- Cross-Browser Compatibility: Ensures consistent behavior across all environments
- Legacy Systems: Older applications may not support newer JavaScript features
- New JavaScript Features: If an ES6 feature is not supported, a polyfill can implement it

##### Example: Missing fetch() API in Old Browsers

Older browsers like Internet Explorer 11 do not support fetch(). A polyfill can provide this functionality:

```javascript
if (!window.fetch) {
  window.fetch = function (url, options) {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      let xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
      xhr.open(options?.method || "GET", url);
      xhr.onload = () =>
        resolve({ json: () => Promise.resolve(JSON.parse(xhr.responseText)) });
      xhr.onerror = () => reject(new Error("Network error"));
      xhr.send(options?.body || null);
    });
  };
}
```

#### How Do Polyfills Work?

A polyfill checks if a feature exists. If the feature is missing, it implements it manually.

##### Steps to Create a Polyfill

1. Check if the feature exists
2. If missing, define it using equivalent logic
3. Ensure compatibility with different environments

#### Popular JavaScript Polyfills

Some widely used polyfills include implementations for:

- fetch() - Native HTTP Requests
- Promise - Asynchronous operations
- Object.assign() - Merging objects
- Array.prototype.includes() - Check if an array contains a value

##### Example: Object.assign() Polyfill

```javascript
if (typeof Object.assign !== "function") {
  Object.assign = function (target, ...sources) {
    if (target == null)
      throw new TypeError("Cannot convert undefined or null to object");

    let to = Object(target);
    sources.forEach((source) => {
      if (source) {
        for (let key in source) {
          if (Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(source, key)) {
            to[key] = source[key];
          }
        }
      }
    });
    return to;
  };
}
```

#### Difference Between Polyfill and Shim

| Feature    | Polyfill                     | Shim                            |
| ---------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Definition | Implements a missing feature | Modifies or extends behavior    |
| Purpose    | Provides compatibility       | Adapts existing functionality   |
| Example    | Promise polyfill             | jQuery modifying native methods |

All polyfills are shims, but not all shims are polyfills!

#### Where to Find Polyfills?

You don't always need to write your own polyfills! There are many third-party polyfill libraries:

- core-js → Provides ES6+ polyfills
- es6-promise → Adds Promise support
- whatwg-fetch → Polyfills fetch()
- MDN Polyfills → Official Mozilla documentation

#### When Should You Use a Polyfill?

##### Use a polyfill if:

- You need to support older browsers
- You are using a critical feature that's missing in some environments
- You want to ensure code consistency across platforms

##### Avoid polyfills if:

- Your project targets only modern browsers
- The polyfill significantly impacts performance
- A modern alternative exists (e.g., Babel transpilation)

#### Polyfills vs. Transpilers (Babel)

| Feature     | Polyfill              | Transpiler (e.g., Babel)   |
| ----------- | --------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Definition  | Adds missing features | Converts new syntax to old |
| Example     | Promise polyfill      | const → var conversion     |
| Method      | Implements functions  | Rewrites code              |
| Performance | May slow execution    | No runtime overhead        |

#### Conclusion

- Polyfills allow modern JavaScript to work in older browsers
- They check for missing features and provide alternative implementations
- Use popular libraries like core-js instead of writing your own polyfills
- Be mindful of performance and compatibility when using polyfills
