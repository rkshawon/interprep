## Understanding JavaScript Execution Context

#### What is an Execution Context (EC)?

In JavaScript, Execution Context is an environment where your code is evaluated and executed.

There are three types of execution contexts:

- **Global Execution Context (GEC)**: Created when a JS file is first run.
- **Function Execution Context (FEC)**: Created whenever a function is invoked.
- **Eval Execution Context**: Created inside eval() (rarely used).

#### 🚀 Execution Context Lifecycle

The lifecycle of an execution context has two phases:

##### 1️⃣ Creation Phase (Memory Creation/Hoisting)

Happens before any code execution.
JS sets up memory space for variables and functions.
Hoisting takes place here (moving declarations to the top).

What happens step-by-step:

###### Create a Global Object:

- In browsers: `window`
- In Node.js: `global`

###### Create `this`:

- In the global context: `this` points to `window` (browser) or `global` (Node.js).
- Inside a function: `this` depends on how the function is called (can be dynamic).

###### Memory allocation for variables and functions:

- Functions: Entire function body is stored (hoisted fully).
- `var`: Gets hoisted, but initialized with `undefined`.
- `let/const`: Gets hoisted but placed in the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) — meaning they can't be accessed until the code execution phase.

Example:

```javascript
console.log(a); // undefined
console.log(b); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'b' before initialization
console.log(add()); // "Hello"

var a = 10;
let b = 20;
const c = 30;

function add() {
  return "Hello";
}
```

What happens in memory:

| Identifier | Value in Creation Phase |
| ---------- | ----------------------- |
| a          | undefined               |
| b          | TDZ                     |
| c          | TDZ                     |
| add        | function add() {}       |

##### 2 Execution Phase (Code Execution)

Now, the code actually runs line by line:

- Variables declared with `var` are updated to their assigned values.
- `let` and `const` exit the TDZ once they are initialized.
- Functions can be called — since they were hoisted in the creation phase.

Execution example:

```javascript
console.log(a); // undefined
console.log(b); // Error (still in TDZ)
console.log(add()); // "Hello"

var a = 10;
let b = 20;
const c = 30;

function add() {
  return "Hello";
}
```

Execution phase:

| Identifier | Final Value |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| a          | 10          |
| b          | 20          |
| c          | 30          |
| add        | function    |

#### 🎯 How are variables stored?

##### 1. `var`:

- Hoisted to the top, but initialized as `undefined`.
- Stored in the Global Object (`window` in browsers).
- Can be redeclared and updated.

Example:

```javascript
console.log(x); // undefined
var x = 5;
console.log(x); // 5
```

##### 2. `let`:

- Hoisted but placed in the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) until initialized.
- Stored in a separate block scope (not attached to `window`).
- Can be updated but not redeclared.

Example:

```javascript
console.log(y); // ReferenceError
let y = 10;
console.log(y); // 10
```

##### 3. `const`:

- Hoisted but in TDZ like `let`.
- Must be initialized at declaration (no default value like `undefined`).
- Immutable binding — can't be reassigned.

Example:

```javascript
const z; // SyntaxError: Missing initializer
const z = 100;
console.log(z); // 100
```

##### 4. Function Declarations:

- Hoisted fully — function definitions are available before execution starts.
- Stored in the Global Object or Function Object.

Example:

```javascript
console.log(foo()); // "I'm a function"

function foo() {
  return "I'm a function";
}
```

##### 5. Function Expressions (with var, let, const):

###### Var + function expression:

- Hoisted, but initialized as `undefined`.

```javascript
console.log(bar()); // TypeError: bar is not a function
var bar = function () {
  return "I'm an expression";
};
```

###### Let/Const + function expression:

- Hoisted, but in TDZ.

```javascript
console.log(bar()); // ReferenceError
let bar = function () {
  return "I'm an expression";
};
```

#### 📦 Recap — Quick Cheatsheet:

| Keyword  | Hoisted? | Initialized?   | Scope           | Redeclaration? | Mutable? |
| -------- | -------- | -------------- | --------------- | -------------- | -------- |
| var      | Yes      | undefined      | Function/Global | Yes            | Yes      |
| let      | Yes      | TDZ            | Block           | No             | Yes      |
| const    | Yes      | TDZ            | Block           | No             | No       |
| Function | Yes      | Defined (full) | Function/Global | N/A            | Yes      |

#### 🔥 Bonus: Nested Execution Contexts

Each time a function is called:

1. A new Execution Context is created.
2. It has its own creation and execution phases.
3. The old Execution Context is pushed to the Execution Stack.
4. Once the function is done, its context is popped off the stack.

Example:

```javascript
function outer() {
  console.log("Outer function");
  inner();
}

function inner() {
  console.log("Inner function");
}

outer();
```

Execution Stack:

```
1. Global Execution Context
2. outer() Execution Context
3. inner() Execution Context (popped off when done)
```

export default ({ children }) => (
  <div className="js-execution-context-guide">{children}</div>
);

;
